Final2 Elaboration
This program will continually read and print the user’s input until ‘q’ is entered.

In the exception handler, receiver control doesn’t need to be checked because we are handling I/O in the first place.

If the read character is ‘q’, the program will immediately quit (syscall code 10).

Otherwise, echo print the read char back to the user.
Then, return to the program.

Since this is contained in the kernel text, the main program can simply be an infinite loop.
But before the loop, we need to enable all interrupts.
