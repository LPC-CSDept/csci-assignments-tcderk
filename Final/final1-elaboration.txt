Final1 Elaboration
This program will take in 3 digits from the user through MMI/O, then print the 3-digit decimal using syscall.
I will need to write this program in 3 sections: inputting digits, calculating the 3-digit decimal, and printing and terminating the program. 
The user will be inputting 3 digits, and I can do the calculation each time a digit is inputted. This inputting and calculating section can be within a loop which terminates after 3 iterations.

Inputting: (Within loop)
Check receiver control ready bit (least significant bit) for a ‘1’.
lw from the receiver data if ‘1’.
Go back to step 1. If ‘0’.

Calculation: (Within loop, after inputting)
Begin with result = 0.
Multiply result by 10 to shift the digits up one tens place.
Subtract 48 from input to convert ASCII to decimal.
Add the input to the result.
When the next input is ready, repeat from step 2.

Printing: (After loop)
Put result in $a0.
Print result using syscall code 1.
Exit program using syscall code 10.
